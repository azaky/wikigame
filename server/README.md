# Wikigame Server

The Wikigame Server is built using express and socket.io.

## Running & Developing Locally

First, ensure that node version &ge; 12 is installed.

To develop, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server will listen at port 9454.

To test, you must [build the extension](https://github.com/azaky/wikigame/tree/master/extension#running--developing-locally) with `-local` (e.g. `npm run dev-local`).
